COMMENT     VALIDATED REFSEQ: This record has undergone validation or
            preliminary review. The reference sequence was derived from V01146.
            The sequence was submitted by the authors [1] on magnetic tape and
            revised according to [3], [4], and [5]. [3] made changes at 8
            positions in gene 1 without affecting the size of the total
            sequence but changing gene 1 amino acids 443, 474, and 388 to 424.
            [4] inserted a T at nucleotide 17511, increasing the total sequence
            to 39937 bp. This change, originally found in T3 DNA [8], revealed
            gene 5.9 and shortened gene 6. [5] changed the nucleotides at 11061
            and 11062 from GT to TG, changing amino acid 119 of T7 lysozyme
            (gene 3.5) from glycine to valine. Features have been extracted
            from [1] unless otherwise noted. The sequence shown is that of the
            l strand, which corresponds to the sequence of all mRNAs of known
            functional significance. Early mRNAs are produced by three major
            promoters for E. coli RNA polymerase A1, A2, and A3, located near
            the left end of the DNA. A fourth major E. coli promoter, A0 (also
            called D), that would direct transcription leftward, and several
            minor E. coli promoters (see Table 6 in [1]) function in vitro but
            have no known in vivo function. Late mRNAs are produced by 15
            promoters for T7 RNA polymerase distributed across the right-most
            85% of the DNA, and named e.g. phi10, for the first gene downstream
            of the promoter. There are also two T7 promoters, phiOL and phiOR,
            associated with possible origins of replication at the left and
            right ends of T7 DNA. The 23 base-pair consensus sequence for T7
            promoters stretches from -17 to +6, where the initiating nucleotide
            is at +1. T7 DNA also contains a 160 base-pair terminal repetition.
            The beginning and end of RNAs are determined by the promoters; by a
            terminator for E. coli RNA polymerase, TE, located at the end of
            the early region; a terminator for T7 RNA polymerase, Tphi, located
            just downstream of gene 10; and a series of RNase III cleavage
            sites. Early mRNAs made by E. coli RNA polymerase are listed in
            Features. The many RNAs predicted to be made by T7 RNA polymerase
            are not listed but can be deduced from the position of the
            transcription signals (see Tables 8 and 9 in [1]). Promoters are
            listed in Features by the known or predicted first nucleotide of
            the RNA, terminators by the last nucleotide of the RNA, and RNase
            III sites by the nucleotide 5' of the position of cleavage. Genes
            are numbered 0.3 to 19.5 in order of their left-to-right position
            on the genome. Proteins are named by the gene number, e.g., the
            gene 1 protein, or by a functional name, e.g., T7 RNA polymerase.
            There is now genetic or biochemical evidence that proteins are
            produced from at least 52 of the 56 T7 genes. Gene 4 produces two
            proteins, 4A and 4B, by initiating translation at two different
            sites in the same reading frame. Gene 10 produces two proteins, 10A
            and 10B, by frameshifting during translation. Genes 0.6 and 5.5
            probably also make two proteins by translational frameshifting, the
            gene 5.5 frameshift producing a gene 5.5-5.7 fusion protein.
            COMPLETENESS: full length.
